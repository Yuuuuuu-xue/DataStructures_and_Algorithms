## LeetCode Problem
Easy 876

## Problem
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Key Idea
Simply use two linked list, `slow` and `fast` where `slow` moves one node at a time and `fast` moves two nodes at a time.

## Complexity Analysis
- Runtime Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution
- [C++](./solution.cpp)
