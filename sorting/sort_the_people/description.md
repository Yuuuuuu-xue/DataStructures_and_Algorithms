## LeetCode Problem
Easy 2418

## Problem
You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `ith` person.

Return the `names` sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

## Example
```
Input: names = ["Mary", "John", "Emma"], heights = [180, 165, 170]
Output: ["Mary", "Emma", "John"]
```

## Key Idea
Simply sort the array.
