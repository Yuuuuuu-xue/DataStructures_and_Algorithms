## Topological Sort
A topological sort of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge `uv` from vertex `u` to `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. 

A topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node `v` is visited only after all its dependencies are visited. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
