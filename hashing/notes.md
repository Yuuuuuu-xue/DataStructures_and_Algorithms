## Hashing
- **Universe of keys U**: is the set of all possible keys
- **Hash table T**: is an array with m positions. Each position is called a **slot** or **bucket**
- **Hash function**: a function, h: U -> {0, 1, 2, ..., m - 1}, maps keys to array position. To access key k, we should check T[h(k)].
- **Collision**: we have two keys x and y where x != y and h(x) == h(y), since |U| > m, collsion is unavoidable.

## Chaining or Closed Addressing
For each slot, we have a linked list. So when collision occurs, we just add it to the linked list.

## Strategy to Design a Key
- When the order of each element in the string / array doesn't matter, we can sort it and use it as our key. For example
  - $(x_0, x_5, x_3, x_4, x_2, x_1)$
  - $(x_3, x_2, x_5, x_1, x_0, x_4)$
  
  can both point to the same key $(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$. 
- In a tree, we may want to use TreeNode as key sometime, but in most cases, the serialization of the subtree might be a better idea. 
- In a matrix, you might want to use the row index and/or the column index as the key
- In a matrix, we might want to aggregate the values in the same column
  - **Diagonal**: (i, j): **i - j**, on the same diagonal line
  - **Anti-diagonal**: (i, j): **i + j**, on the same anti-diagonal line
