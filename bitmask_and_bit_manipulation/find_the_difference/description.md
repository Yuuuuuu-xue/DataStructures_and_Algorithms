## LeetCode Problem
Easy 389

## Problem
You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Example
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

## Key Idea
Note if we `'a' XOR 'a' = 0`. The difference between `s` and `t` is just one single character. We can simply XOR all the characters in `s` and `t`, we will get the final result.

## Complexity Analysis
- Runtime Complexity: O(n + m) where n = len(s) and m = len(t)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
