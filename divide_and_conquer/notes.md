### Divide and Conquer
- **Divide**: divide the problem into two or more smaller instances of the same problem (subproblems)
- **Conquer**: if the subproblem is small enough, return the solution directly; otherwise, solve it recursively
- **Combine**: combine the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem
