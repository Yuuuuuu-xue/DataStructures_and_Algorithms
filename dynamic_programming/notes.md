## Dynamic Programming
- A **dynamic programming algorithm** for an optimization problem is basically a recursive solution that uses **memoization** to solve repeated calls to the same subproblems.
- We can apply dynamic programming to solve a problem if:
  - A problem exhibits **optimal substructure** if an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems.
  - A problem is said to have **overlapping subproblems** if subproblems share subsubproblem, or requivalently, if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times. 

## Five Steps of Dynamic Programming
1. Defining the optimal substructure / recursive structure
2. Array definition for memoization
3. Defining the recurrence relation in terms of the array
4. Bottom-up iterative algorithm
5. Find one optimum solution using the array values

## Differece between Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy Algorithm
- **Brute force** algorithm explores every possible solution from the solution space. Often ended up with time-limited exceed or space-limited exceed.
- **Dynamic Programming** algorithm first finds optimal solutions to subproblems and then makes an informed chocie. It's important to make sure that they are only a polynomial number of subproblems.
- **Greedy** algorithm first makes a greedy choice - the choice that looks best at the moment and then solves a resulting subproblem, without bothering to solve all possible related smaller subproblems.
