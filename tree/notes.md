## Tree
- **height** of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a child
  - The height of a tree consisting of a single node is 0
- **depth** of a tree is the length of the path from the root to that node
  - The depth of the root is 0
- **predecessor**: one step left and then right till you can
- **successor**: one step right and then left till you can
- **in order**: left subtree, root, right subtree
- **pre order**: root, left subtree, right subtree
- **post order**: left subtree, right subtree, root
- **complete binary tree**:
   1. all the leaves must lean to left.
   2. the last leaf element might not have a right subling. It doesn't have to be a
        full binary tree.
