## Greedy Algorithm
A greedy algorithm for an optimization problem is one that makes a **locally optimal choice** (a choice that looks best at the moment) at every step hoping it leads to a **globally optimal solution**.

## Optimal Substructure
A problem exhibits **optimal substructure** if an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems.
