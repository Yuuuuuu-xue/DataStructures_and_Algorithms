## Notes
A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. 

If we need to pop smaller elements from the stack before pushing a new element, the stack is decreasing from bottom to top.

Otherwise, it's increasing from bottom to top.

For example, the monotonic decreasing stack:
```
Before: [5, 4, 2, 1]
To push 3, we need to pop smaller elements (or equal) elements first
After: [5, 4, 3]
```

If we need to calculate both `nextSmaller` or `prevSmaller` arrays, we can do it using a mono-stack in one pass.
