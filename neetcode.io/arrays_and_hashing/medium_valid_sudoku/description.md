## LeetCode Problem
Medium 36

## Description
Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

Note:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## Example
```
Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

## Basic Idea
For this problem, we will label each row, column and subbox with an unique identifier. For given i, j, the unique identifiers are:
- Row: R_i
- Column: C_j
- Subbox: S_(j // 3 + i // 3 * 3)
Then simply maps those unique identifier to a hashset. If two same elements exist in any of the hashsets, then return false otherwise true.
