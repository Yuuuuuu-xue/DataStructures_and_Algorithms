## Priority Queue ADT
#### Data:
- A collection of items PQ where each item x has an associated priority
#### Operations:
- **Insert(PQ, x, priority)**: add x to the priority queue PQ with the given priority
- **FindMax(PQ)**: return an item in PQ with the highest priority
- **ExtractMax(PQ)**: remove and return an item from PQ with the highest priority

## Nearly Complete Binary Tree
- binary tree
- every row is completely filled except possibly the last (lowest) row
- lowest row is filled from the left

## Max Heap
- the value at every node is equal to or greater than the value of its immediate children.
- it is a nearly complete binary tree

## Min Heap
- the value at every node is equal to or less than the value of its immediate children.
- it is a nearly complete binary tree
