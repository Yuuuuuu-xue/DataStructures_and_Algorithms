## LeetCode Problem
Easy 3392

## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of subarrays of length 3 such that the sum of the first and third numbers equal exactly half of the second number.
  
## Example:
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 4, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Only the subarray [1, 4, 1] contains exactly 3 elements where the sum of the first and third numbers equals half the middle number
```

## Key Idea
A simple loop.

## Complexity Analysis
